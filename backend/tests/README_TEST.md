To test this application, I recommend using pytest with a fixture-based approach that creates a test database connection and wraps each test in a transaction that's rolled back after completion. Start by testing core database operations in test_db.py, then create endpoint tests in files like test_payments_api.py that use FastAPI's TestClient. Focus first on testing the critical payment operations (CRUD, split payments) with realistic data scenarios. Create fixtures that populate the database with sample clients, contracts, and payments to test complex view data. For parameterized tests, use pytest's parametrize decorator to test different filtering scenarios. Maintain test isolation by having each test create and clean up its own data, and consider using pytest-asyncio for async endpoint testing. This approach gives you solid test coverage without overengineering the test suite - start with the most business-critical operations and expand from there.

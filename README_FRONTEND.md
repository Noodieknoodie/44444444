//// SIDEBAR: CLIENT SELECTION ////
- Search Bar: Filters clients dynamically as user types.

- Client/Provider View Toggle (defaults to Client View):

Client View:
- Displays clients individually by name with initials/icon.
- Clearly but subtly indicates client status ("PAID"/"UNPAID") for the current period.
- Selecting a client refreshes the main page content accordingly.

Provider View:
- Displays providers, collapsed by default.
- Clicking a provider expands to reveal associated clients.
- Clients follow the same selection behavior and status indicators as in Client View.

- Expected Fee
- Amount Received
- Variance: Clearly indicated as "+/- $xx.xx" with visual cues for overpayment/underpayment.
- Actions: [View Attachment (conditionally visible), Edit, Delete]

Handling Split Payments:
- Displays total payment clearly on the main row, collapsible (collapsed by default).
- Expanded view shows individual payments within clearly.
- Muted display for AUM, Expected Fee, Variance on collapsed rows for clarity.

//// DOCUMENT VIEWER SPLIT-SCREEN ////

- Purpose: To efficiently view scanned documents (checks, payments, attachments) alongside payment details for quick manual verification.
- Triggered when selecting the "View Attachment" action from a payment in the Payment History table.
- Viewer slides in smoothly from the right, splitting the page clearly into a 60% (main page) / 40% (document viewer) layout.
- When active, the client navigation sidebar automatically hides to maximize screen space.
- Document viewer remains fixed ("sticky")—it does not scroll with the main content area.
- Supports PDFs, PNGs, JPGs, and JPEGs with zoom capabilities for detailed inspection.
- Allows independent scrolling within the document viewer for multi-page files, functioning similarly to a standalone PDF viewer.
- While open, the main payment page adjusts intelligently: non-essential details (last payment summaries, action buttons, or irrelevant page elements) temporarily hide, ensuring clear focus on essential information.
- A clearly visible "Close" button exits the viewer and restores the original layout, including the return of the client navigation sidebar.
- All elements and transitions are precisely coordinated to maintain seamless interaction and usability.

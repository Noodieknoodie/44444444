# 401k Application Quick Fix Guide

## THE PROBLEM

The application is failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'` because:

1. Your Python code uses absolute imports (`from backend.services...`)
2. But you're running the app from inside the `backend` directory
3. Python can't find a module named "backend" when you're already inside it

## QUICK FIX OPTIONS

### Option 1: Fix imports in your code (RECOMMENDED)

The cleanest solution is to update your imports to be relative:

```python
# Change this:
from backend.services.document_service import DocumentService

# To this:
from services.document_service import DocumentService
```

We've already fixed these imports in:
- `backend/main.py`
- `backend/routers/documents.py`

### Option 2: Set PYTHONPATH (QUICK WORKAROUND)

If you don't want to change your code:

```bash
# On Windows (run in Command Prompt)
set PYTHONPATH=C:\CODING\401401401
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## HOW TO VERIFY IT'S FIXED

1. Run the backend server properly:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Try accessing http://localhost:8000/api/clients in your browser
   - If it returns data, your backend is working!

3. If all API calls are working but you still see frontend errors:
   - Check your browser console for details
   - Make sure your frontend is using the correct API URL
